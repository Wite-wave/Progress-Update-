Max cartQty set to 10 and to display a message if exceeded.
Clicking +3 till it reachs full capacity will go beyond cart max.
Clicking +3 reaches a halt at 12 before declaring max capacity reached.

Happens when +3 is clicked after either +2, +3, or +5 are clicked, i.e will not work if you start by pushing
another button say +4.
This only happens when clicked in a certain order

+3,  +3, +3, +5 = 14
+3, +3, +3, +3 = 12
+5 ,+3, +3 = 11
+2 ,+3, +3 = 11

I suspect this happens only because the bug is caught mid through calculation.

Bug Fix:

Rewriting the code as such will fix the issue

for (cartQty >= 10){

	console.log('Cart Full');
	cartQty = 10;

} else {
	cartQty += 3
}
